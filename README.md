# Time Goalie

An Android App for setting goals and implementing habits that are time-based.  Rather than setting a goal of I want to exercise every day, you can use Time Goalie to set a goal to exercise for 20 minutes a day. 
Timers can be paused and resumed to accomodate for busy days where you don't have contiguous time to accomplish your goals.

This was my capstone project for my Udacity Android Nanodegree

## Getting Started
The firebaseServer portion of this code can be deployed to Firebase Cloud Functions--this backend will respond to a trigger which will send a push notification to any registered devices
`npm install` if you want to install locally.
TimeGoalie can be compiled in Android Studioonce provided with a signing configuration

## Todo

*Convert to MVVM architecture
*Refactor database access with Room, instead of content providers.
*Freshen up UI
